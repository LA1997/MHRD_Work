1,Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired,"The Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired is a co-robotic navigation aid that enhances mobility for visually and physically impaired. The goal is to develop a co-robotic cane for the visually impaired that has enhanced navigation capabilities and that can relay critical information about the environment to its user.Using computer vision, the proposed cane recognizes indoor structures such as stairways and doors, as well as detect potential obstacles. Using an intuitive human-device interaction mechanism, the cane will then convey the appropriate travel direction to the user.The objective if the project is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC). The CRC collaborates with users via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life.

3,Visually Impaired Assistant (Via),"-------- PROTOTYPE --------- PURPOSE: To design a prototype of an electronic obstacle detector and navigation aid for individuals who are blind or have low vision. The Visually Impaired Assistant (VIA) is a pair of devices worn on the hands that use video motion detection technology combined with 4 mini cameras to detect obstacles as a person walks. It is intended to be used in place of a white cane. As the one of the VIA devices detects obstacles, it vibrates to warn the user to turn away from the obstruction. To aid with navigation, the VIA has a voice-operated GPS system. The user speaks a location into the GPS device, and it guides him/her to that destination. The VIA devices use separate vibration mechanisms from the obstacle alert feature to guide the user toward the final destination. VIA is charged with a wirelessly functioning mat.

4,Getting To Know You: A Social Skills and Ability Awareness Curriculum,"Getting To Know You is a social skills/awareness curriculum for grades K-12 in which blind and visually impaired students and sighted students interact and get to know each other. 
Social skills instruction provides students with tools to interact and play effectively, develop and maintain friendships, interpret non-verbal cues, and successfully seek and maintain employment and independent living opportunities as adults. For blind and visually impaired students, the acquisition of social skills is a process that requires ongoing instruction and feedback from teachers, specialists, family members, and peers.
 
The Getting to Know You kit is designed for VI teachers, orientation & mobility specialists, other related service personnel, general education teachers, and families. Authors Nita Crow and Stephanie Herlich have created a curriculum that engages students who are blind and visually impaired with their sighted age-mates in activities that promote social competence and awareness of the ways in which students who are blind or visually impaired learn social skills.
 
Lessons can be initiated at lunch or during classroom free time. Each lesson takes 30-45 minutes to complete so that interference with academic activities is limited. Each lesson contains a clearly stated objective, skills addressed, an introduction, a list of materials needed, and a step-by-step explanation of the activities. An icon at the top of each page identifies whether a lesson is about social skills, ability awareness, or a combination of the two.","['mobility specialists', 'family members', 'VI teachers', 'lunch', 'tool', 'blind', 'process', 'ability awareness', 'students interact', 'skills/awareness curriculum', 'combination', 'grades K-12', 'education teachers', 'page', 'student', 'icon', 'Authors Nita Crow', 'competence', 'Social', 'feedback', 'adult', 'service personnel', 'acquisition', 'peer', 'Stephanie Herlich', 'teacher', 'curriculum', 'age-mates', 'activity', 'orientation', 'way', 'lesson', 'employment', 'minute', 'awareness', 'Lessons', 'instruction', 'interference', 'time', 'cue', 'material', 'family', 'specialist', 'living opportunities', 'Know', 'friendship', 'list', 'introduction', 'skill', 'top', 'explanation']",03/25/2015,https://abledata.acl.gov/product/getting-know-you-social-skills-and-ability-awareness-curriculum
5,Navigational Aids For The Visually Impaired (Navi),"---- PROTOTYPE --------- PURPOSE: To create a prototype of an adapted Kinect sensor to help improve the indoor navigation of individuals with visual disabilities. Engineering students at the University of Konstanz in Germany have developed a prototype to improve indoor navigation for individuals with visual impairment using the Microsoft Kinect camera, a vibrotactile waistbelt, and markers from the AR-Toolkit. Navigational Aids for the Visually Impaired (NAVI), consists of a helmet-mounted Kinect sensor connected to a computer in a backpack, a special belt containing vibration motors to warn the users of obstacles ahead and to the sides, and a Bluetooth headset to provide verbal feedback. Altogether, the NAVI device assists and individual with who are blind or have low vision navigate to a specific location with tactile and verbal warnings of objects in their path. The system can even detect bar-coded signs and provide further information to the user. The Kinect is mapped onto three pairs of Arduino LilyPad vibration motors located at the left, center and right of the waist. These pairs of vibration motors are hot glued into a fabric waist belt and connected to an Arduino 2009 board. To increase the impact of the vibration motors, each was they put into the cap of a plastic bottle. The Arduino in the waist belt is connected via USB to a laptop that is mounted on a special backpack and has holes for cables and fan. Students wanted to utilize the RGB camera of the Kinect, so they placed several markers of the AR-Toolkit on the walls and doors of the building thereby modeling a certain route from one room to another. The markers are tracked continuously all along the way and the developed software provided synthesized auditory navigation instructions for the person. These navigation instructions vary based on the distance of the person to the marker . For example, if the user walks toward a door, the output will be “Door ahead in 3”, “2”, “1”, “pull the door” as the distance to the marker on the door is reduced. The software was written with C# and .NET. Students used the MangedOpenNI (https://github.com/kobush/ManagedOpenNI) wrapper for the Kinect and the managed wrapper of the ARToolkitPlus (http://code.google.com/p/comp134artd) for marker tracking. Voice synthesis was done using Microsoft’s Speech API (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/speech/default). All input streams were glued together using Reactive Extensions for .NET (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/ee794896).

17,Smart Baby Buggy,"The Smart Baby Buggy is a sensored baby stroller specifically designed for parents who are blind or visually impaired. Ramona Williams, a woman who is visually impaired, and a team of students from the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London, came together to create a stroller that can sense its surroundings and send the user audible and haptic feedback through its handlebar and the accompanying mobile app.Inside the base of the baby carrier, the Smart Baby Buggy is equipped with ultrasound and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors, which can measure distances between it and other objects using light from a pulsed laser. If these sensors detect any objects or obstacles in their path, they will transmit these signals to the processor which will then relay this information to the vibration motors located inside the handlebar. The handlebar will start to vibrate to notify the user that he or she is approaching an object/obstacle in his path, and the vibrations will increase in intensity as the user draws nearer to it. Then the user can better estimate how far he is from the object/obstacle and maneuver the stroller around it. The Smart Baby Buggy app also alerts the user to changes in ground surfaces (e.g., curbs, drop-offs, corners) with audible beeps via Bluetooth.The Smart Baby Buggy also features a cradle for the user’s smartphone, a bracket that can hold the user’s cane when traveling with the stroller, and a bright yellow “Visually impaired parent” sign on the front to inform others that the user has a visual impairment.","['light', 'information', 'Detection', 'object', 'Smart Baby Buggy app', 'change', 'path', 'drop-off', 'signal', 'woman', 'processor', 'Ramona Williams', 'laser', 'student', 'others', 'corner', 'intensity', 'Ranging', 'feedback', 'parent ” sign', 'baby stroller', 'team', '“', 'object/obstacle', 'front', 'impairment', 'user', 'sensor', 'beep', 'e.g.', 'Smart Baby Buggy', 'baby carrier', '’ s cane', 'obstacle', 'distance', 'handlebar', 'vibration motors', 'cradle', 'ground surfaces', 'base', 'user ’ s smartphone', 'surroundings', 'Bluetooth.The Smart Baby Buggy', 'Department', 'LIDAR', 'Bioengineering', 'Imperial College London', 'curb', 'vibration', 'bracket', 'parent', 'stroller']",07/05/2018,https://abledata.acl.gov/product/smart-baby-buggy

The Rings are worn around the user’s fingers, and the bracelet is the display screen to view the text.These are wearable devices and come in a set of two objects- the rings and the bracelet. They are a collection of six rings that the hearing impaired person wears on the thumb, index finger and middle finger of each hand. The bracelet is worn on either wrist. The two come as a set and are of no use individually.The Device works when a person talks using sign language, these rings ‘comprehend’ the different movements made by the hands and communicate this information to the bracelet. The bracelet then converts the sign language into words which are then heard from speakers embedded within the bracelet. These items can work vice versa as well. Meaning the bracelet ‘hears’ what the other person is saying and converts it into text that appears on the bracelet itself. The hearing impaired person can then just simply read what is written on the bracelet, thus making the communication circle complete.","['index finger', 'hearing', 'information', 'text', 'language', 'communication circle complete', 'person talks', 'item', 'Sign Language Rings', 'wrist', 'speaker', 'display screen', 'movement', 'device', 'use', 'hand', 'user', 'finger', 'word', '’ s sign language motions', 'person', 'set', 'vice versa', 'Device works', 'bracelet', 'thumb', 'Rings', 'bracelet ‘', 'collection', 'convert', 'person wears', 'voice', 'text.These', 'ring', 'user ’ s fingers', 'sign language', 'top']",10/24/2016,https://abledata.acl.gov/product/sign-language-rings
19,Ultrasonic Goggles,"---- PROTOTYPE --------- PURPOSE: To design a prototype of goggles that assist individuals who have low vision to navigate. Researchers at the Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, Spain have developed a pair of ultrasonic goggles that are intended to make it safer and easier for people who have low vision to get around. Individuals with partial sight experience ""Terminator-style vision"" through the use of two cameras mounted onto a virtual reality headset that is then connected to a small computer. The device scans the area that lies in front of the wearer and displays relevant information concerning the scene in the form of color-coded outlines that allow the user to know the distance and the shape of objects which are traditionally difficult to see or interpret. The device detects objects and people who move within the visual field that a person with no visual disabilities has. Often, the unaided user will not detect these objects due to problems of contrast. Testing is being currently being done within a group of sample patients, and results will be available by the end of 2012 and will be used to improve on future models. AUTHOR: Edwin Kee.

20,Sighted Wheelchair,"---- PROTOTYPE --------- PURPOSE: To create a prototype of a robotic wheelchair that uses three dimensional (3D) imaging to allow individuals who are blind or have low vision and use a wheelchair to ""see"" when navigating in the indoor and outdoor environment. Researchers at the Luleå University of Technology (LTU) in Sweden have developed a wheelchair that uses a laser sensor to generate a 3D map of its surroundings, which is then transferred to an on-board haptic robot, allowing the robot to navigate its way around any obstacles. The laser scanner uses time-of-flight technique. Developed by Kalevi Hyyppä and his research team at the LTU division EISLAB, the Sighted Wheelchair has a joystick for steering and the haptic robot acts as a virtual white cane. The 3D map is transferred to the haptic robot so that a visually impaired wheelchair driver can ""feel or see"" obstacles such as open doors or oncoming people and navigate past them. The device was tested by a student with visual impairments who found the experience similar to using a white cane. More research is necessary to improve the Sighted Wheelchair. For example, the laser can only recognize objects at a specific height, while ignoring everything above or below its field of vision. Researchers are also busy developing a new 3D camera for the chair and are hoping to have it ready for commercial use within the next five years. AUTHOR: Amar Toor.

65,Triangle,"Triangle is a scientific math program with voice and tactile output designed for use by students and professionals in math, science, and engineering who are blind or have low vision. It is intended to provide a workspace for reading, writing, and manipulating mathematics. It uses GS (Gardner-Salinas) braille notation, a linear notation for scientific expressions with syntax modeled on the page markup language LaTeX, which is widely used by professional scientists and mathematicians. GS symbols that are not on the standard keyboard may be entered using a braille keyboard option or several menu selection options. This scientific math program features a math/science word processor, a graphing calculator, a viewer for y versus x plots, a table viewer, and a program for audio and/or braille-assisted reading of tactile figures on an external digitizing pad (the Touch-and-Tell program). The graphing calculator feature displays graphs and functions in visual, auditory, and tactile formats. It permits evaluation of most standard math expressions. Results are returned to the scratchpad buffer and may be cut and pasted to other documents. The calculator will also evaluate functions y versus x that can be viewed in audio using a tone graph viewer that provides the user with a quick semi-quantitative overview. A moving icon on the screen provides similar information for a deaf blind user. The table viewer feature allows users to read, navigate, and edit complex tables in an easy-to-use manner. Tables can be read cell by cell or line by line. The latter option is useful for small tables being read in braille, but the first is usually preferable when speech synthesis is used or when tables are large. Tables may also be created or edited in this viewer. The word processor has five different document buffers that provide basic editing capabilities, including search and cut and paste operations. In the word processor, the keyboard or any assistive device/software that emulates a keyboard may be used for input. Output may be viewed visually on the DOS text screen; audibly using a screen-reading program and external voice synthesizer for text and the PC speaker or a SB16-compatible sound output for other audio; tactually using a braille screen access program and external refreshable braille display; or using any combination of the above simultaneously. The Touch-and-Tell program provides alternate-mode display for information presented visually in figures. The user selects an object or region on a figure that is mounted on a digitizing tablet. The touch-and-tell program then displays textual information about that object or region. This information can be read visually, audibly, or in braille. This scientific math program supports the Nomad tablet, the Edmark Touch Window, and the MagicTouch touch screen digitizing tablets. The Objectif program was made to facilitate preparation of the files and tactile figures used with this viewer. COMPATIBILITY: For use with IBM and compatible computers. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For voice output, a DOS screen reading program such as Vocal-Eyes versions 2.2 and 3.0 or JAWS for DOS 2.3; a speech synthesizer such as Apollo, DECtalk Express, DoubleTalk, Keynote Gold, or MultiVoice, or a device with a speech synthesizer built into its functionality such as Freedom Scientific's Type 'n Speak and Braille 'n Speak devices or the American Printing House for the Blind's Nomad touch tablet; and drivers for the synthesizer. For braille output, a braille screen reader that supports a dictionary option for all 256 DOS screen characters and a braille display that permits downloading of braille tables. The GS8 braille table for representing the GS braille code in DOS characters may be loaded into the TSI Gateway screen reader that is included, with the permission of TSI, in the Triangle distribution files, and this screen reader can be used with any 8-dot TSI Navigator or Power Braille refreshable braille display.

71,Sign Voice Language Translator,"---- PROTOTYPE --------- PURPOSE: To design a prototype communication device for an individual who is blind or has low vision and an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing to communicate with each other. As one individual cannot see sign gestures and the other cannot hear voices this makes communication between these two disability types very difficult. The Sign Voice Language Translator (SVLT) is a portable device that can translate sign language into speech and speech into displayed text. The SVLT is worn as a pendant that has a small cameral in the middle surrounded by a black LCD screen that displays text in small amounts around the camera. There is a microphone incorporated into the necklace holding the pendant, and an earbud that connects to the pendant and is placed in the ear a hearing user. When the individual with visual impairment speaks to the individual with hearing impairment, the device converts the voice into text on the display screen, and the individual who is hearing impaired can read the text on the LCD. Conversely, when the hearing impaired individual uses sign language to express a thought, the device converts the sign language, read through its camera, into speech so the individual with visual impairment can hear the meaning of the sign through the earbud. This device could also be used by a person without disability to communicate with an individual who uses sign language. TITLE: Blind and Deaf Communication. WEBSITE: Yanko Design.

141,Finger-mounted reading device for the blind,"Finger-mounted reading device for the blind is designed for use by individuals who have low vision or are blind. Researchers at the MIT Media Laboratory have built a prototype of a finger-mounted device with a built-in camera that converts written text into audio for visually impaired users. The device provides feedback — either tactile or audible — that guides the user’s finger along a line of text, and the system generates the corresponding audio in real time.The key to the system’s real-time performance is an algorithm for processing the camera’s video feed. Each time the user positions his or her finger at the start of a new line, the algorithm makes a host of guesses about the baseline of the letters. Since most lines of text include letters whose bottoms descend below the baseline, and because skewed orientations of the finger can cause the system to confuse nearby lines, those guesses will differ. But most of them tend to cluster together, and the algorithm selects the median value of the densest cluster.","['baseline', 'start', '—', 'cluster', 'text', 'camera ’ s video feed', 'time.The key', 'blind', 'MIT Media Laboratory', 'device', 'use', 'line', 'algorithm', 'user', 'finger', 'bottom', 'system', 'orientation', 'individual', 'letter', 'user positions', 'performance', 'vision', 'time', 'camera', 'audio', 'reading device', 'tactile', 'host', 'value', 'prototype', 'user ’ s finger', 'guess', 'Researchers']",10/20/2015,https://abledata.acl.gov/product/finger-mounted-reading-device-blind

When the passenger presses the textured button located on the device’s center, the unit’s built-in camera snaps a picture of the outside scenery. The prototype then converts the captured frame into a high-contrast monochrome image and reproduces it on the car window using LEDs. When the passenger drags his or her fingers across the glass, each of the different shades of gray depicting the captured image will vibrate at a different intensity - 255 in all. This way, the passenger can visualize a part of the passing landscape in his or her mind’s eye by feeling the depicted image. In addition to providing haptic feedback, Feel the View provides audio feedback as well. An integrated voice interface connected to the car’s audio system will provide a brief description of the captured image, offering the passenger with context (e.g., “snowy mountain”) of what he or she is touching.Feel the View is a prototype of Ford’s Italian division and its local agency, GTB Rome.","['touch', 'LEDs', 'car ’ s backseat windows', 'scenery', 'image', 'View', 'shade', 'car window', 'Feel', 'passing landscape', 'context', 'GTB Rome', 'intensity', 'glass', 'unit', 'feedback', 'device', 'car ’ s audio system', 'snowy mountain ”', 'addition', 'device ’ s center', 'frame', 'finger', 'part', 'mind ’ s eye', 'passenger', 'way', 'button', 'voice interface', 'picture', 'division', 'Ford ’ s', 'sound', 'camera', 'description', 'imaging system', 'monochrome image', 'prototype', 'agency', 'top']",05/14/2018,https://abledata.acl.gov/product/feel-view

197,Smartcane,"DO-IT-YOURSELF ENTRY --- PURPOSE: To create an electronic travel visual aid device which fits on the top fold of the white cane. It serves as an enhancement to white cane and overcomes its limitations by detecting knee above and hanging obstacles. For safe mobility, it is important that such obstacles are detected early. The cane has other uses as a spatial awareness device as it can detect presence/absence of objects in the surroundings. Further, as compared to the white cane, the detection distance is increased from 0.5 meters to 3 meters. It informs about the presence of objects before actually touching the object with the cane and thus helps in preventing unwanted contact. This avoids socially awkward situations like collision with people while walking or unsafe collisions with animals or into trash.
SmartCaneTM device uses ultrasonic ranging to detect objects in its path and generates tactile output in the form of different vibratory patterns. These vibrations convey the distance information and thus enable the user to negotiate the obstacles from a safe distance.

It is designed for individuals with cognitive capabilities of 1 year and older. It is a colorful, 3D simulated matching program made up of 20 different matching activities covering shapes, colors, objects, animals, food, letters and numbers. Each matching activity has 3 objects to be matched. One at a time, the object to be matched moves back and forth across the top of the screen, pausing over one of the three objects for a pre-specified number of seconds. When the moving object is over the area where it belongs, the user should press the switch. If the user presses correctly, the object will move down to its match and stay there while a voice cheerfully says that it is correct. If the user presses the switch when it is over the incorrect match, the object will move down showing that it does not belong there and a voice will tell the user to try again. The object will then go back up and continue moving across the screen over the other objects. This program is also appropriate for users who are blind or visually impaired by just matching the objects based totally on the program’s auditory narration of the objects.SIZES: 50 meg hard disk space .

228,Blind-Drivable Vehicle,"---- PROTOTYPE --------- PURPOSE: To create a prototype of a car that can be driven independently by blind and visually impaired individuals. The National Federation of the Blind (NFB) and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, College of Engineering (Virginia Tech) has partnered to demonstrate the first-street vehicle equipped with technology allowing a blind person to drive independently. The NFB Jernigan Institute—the only research and training facility on blindness operated by the blind—has challenged universities, technology developers, and other interested innovators to establish NFB Blind Driver Challenge (BDC) teams, in collaboration with the NFB, to build interface technologies that will empower blind people to drive a car independently. The purpose of the NFB Blind Driver Challenge is to stimulate the development of non-visual interface technology. Undergraduate students at Virginia Tech’s College of Engineering, under the direction of Professor Dennis Hong, have been actively working with the NFB on the challenge. During the summer of 2009 the Virginia Tech BDC team worked with blind students in the NFB Youth Slam on the first-generation prototype of a blind-drivable vehicle, and many of the NFB students had the opportunity to drive using the first generation of the non-visual interface. Dr. Hong and his students are currently working with the NFB on the second-generation prototype vehicle, which will integrate new and improved versions of the first-generation non-visual interface technologies into a Ford Escape.

235,Speedy Recovery Vehicle,"---- PROTOTYPE --------- PURPOSE: To design and assemble a wheelchair that is fun and visually appealing to children with disabilities. The Speedy Recovery Vehicle combines the functionality of traditional wheelchairs with the visually appealing design of racing dune buggies. The vehicle includes a custom-welded frame, smooth rolling wheels, a reclining seat, footrests, armrests, safety belt, an IV pole, storage area for an oxygen tank, and a colorful interactive steering wheel. Its small size makes it easy to store, and ideal for children in the two to six-year-old age group. The frame is constructed from 1 inch diameter aluminum tubing, making it lightweight and non-porous. Contoured handles make it easy for hospital staff to push the vehicle, and they can clean and sterilize it with traditional disinfectants made for non-porous equipment. The front caster wheels are solid polyurethane and 2 inch in diameter, while the rear pneumatic wheels have an 8 inch diameter. Custom welding of the frame was performed by KBC Machine Shop (Sterling Heights, Michigan). The seat of the vehicle, like a wheelchair, can be reclined 30 degrees back from upright, in 5-degree increments by moving a retaining pin. The seat is made out of plywood and covered with high-quality foam and non-porous vinyl fabric. It easily supports the weight of a child in the 2-6 age group. The back support of the seat is 18 inches tall. The seat is 14 by 14 inches, and is 12 inches from the base of the vehicle. The frame is painted red, and racing stripes and a decorative logo are stitched into the seat fabric. The vehicle is 42 inches long and 16 inches wide, allowing it to be stored more easily than other devices available for children in the hospital. Two pairs of footrests are provided, both constructed from the same materials as the seat. One pair resides on the floor of the vehicle; 12 inches lower than the seat, and can support the child’s legs at a 90-degree angle. The other pair resides on the front of the vehicle, supporting a child’s extended legs. Either pair can be topped with an appropriate pillow to provide for different sized children. The steering wheel is mounted on a pivoting arm, so it can be rotated out of the way when placing a child inside the vehicle. It contains a cartoon of the highway that moves as the wheel is rotated and bright buttons with pictures of different animals that make sounds when pushed. An oxygen tank can be stored either in an upright position on a 4.5 inch wide metal platform at the rear of the vehicle, or at a 45-degree angle under the seat. A metal chain attached to the back of the seat prevents the oxygen tank from toppling when stored upright. A holding device is built underneath the seat for the 45-degree angle storage and the foot-rests serve as a ledge for the bottom of the tank. An IV pole, constructed from ½ inch aluminum tubing, extends 29 inches from the top of the seat of the vehicle. It contains a hook at the top that can support the IV. Aluminum armrests on each side of the seat prevent the child from falling out sideways. One end of each armrest is attached to the seat frame with a pin that can easily be removed by the hospital staff to move the armrest out of the way when placing a child inside. A safety belt is attached to the bottom seat cushion to secure the child firmly in the seat. Cost of the Speedy Recovery Vehicle was about $610. TITLE: Speedy Recovery Vehicle.

267,Virtual Cane,"-- PROTOTYPE --------- PURPOSE: To create a prototype of a handheld device that uses sonar-type technology to create a virtual white cane that allows users who are blind or with low vision navigate within their environment. The Virtual Cane is a handheld device that uses a type of sonar to recognize physical objects up to 10 meters (39 feet) from the user. When pointed at an object, it emits invisible focused sound waves and determines how far away the object is. The information is then relayed to the user via a series of vibrations which vary in intensity depending on the distance. The device is designed to enable an individual who is blind or has low vision to assess the arrangement of surrounding physical objects (such as their size or height) by constantly scanning the environment using sonar similar to the natural sonar of a bat or a dolphin. There is potential for this device to integrate a facial recognition function to distinguish between smiling and sad faces. It may also be used to further research on reorganization of the brain in the blind. The Virtual Cane is easy to learn, lightweight, and features a battery life of up to 12 hours. Currently this device is presented as a prototype but has retail potential through Hebrew University’s research and development company, Yissum. A patent has been filed and Yissum is looking for business partners to further commercial development. It is estimated that the device would eventually cost approximately $100. AUTHOR: Pawel Piejko.

268,Diy Talking Shampoo Or Conditioner Bottle,"---- DO IT YOURSELF ENTRY --------- PURPOSE: To create a do-it-yourself auditory alert for a shampoo or conditioner bottle for the elderly and/or individuals with visual impairments. The bottle plays an auditory message (e.g., ""shampoo"" or ""conditioner"") when the lid is opened. The message is intended to help someone differentiate or identify bath products when in the shower or bathing. Step 1: Record a message onto a recordable greeting card. Open and close the card to check that the message has been recorded satisfactorily. Step 2: Tear open the greeting card carefully to reveal the circuitry inside. Inside the card are a speaker, a circuit board, a switch, and the button that is pressed to record the message onto the card. The speaker is activated by opening the card. When the card is opened, the speaker turns on and plays the recorded message. Step 3: With scissors, cut the wires to the record button. The record button on the upper right is connected to the circuit board by two wires. Cut these wires as close to the circuit board as possible. Step 4: Trim excess card stock from around the circuit. The circuit board and speaker, as well as the plastic piece of the switch that activates the speaker when the card is opened should be glued to the card. With the scissors, cut away the excess card stock. DO NOT cut through the plastic piece of the switch that connects to the front flap of the card. Step 5: Wrap the remainder of the card and circuitry in a sheet of plastic wrap. Be sure to wrap it so that the hinge at the plastic switch can still fold over. The goal of wrapping the card in plastic wrap is to make it waterproof. One layer free of holes and securely wrapped should be all that is necessary. Step 6: Using the packing tape, securely tape the plastic-wrapped card to the back of the bottle. One layer of tape should do it. The more tape used, the less likely that the device can be used again on another bottle. Also, tape down the switch to the top of the bottle. When taped correctly, opening the lid of the bottle should activate the speaker. Find the right spot for the card on the bottle and lid before taping it down. If not positioned correctly, the speaker may not go off when the lid is opened. Step 7: When the lid of the shampoo bottle is opened, the speaker activates and speaks the message. It is recommended to test this in the shower to ensure that the speaker is loud enough to be heard over the spray of the shower head (if not taking a bath). In a few tests (3-4 showers), the card has proven to be waterproof. However, it is suggested that the shampoo/conditioner be stored out of the direct ""line of fire"" of the shower spray. TOOLS: Packing tape, A recordable greeting card (with or without music), Scissors, Plastic wrap (e.g. Saran wrap), Shampoo or Conditioner with a lid that pops up to open.

This stand-alone device can be used by a person that can operate one or two switches. The user plugs a switch-adapted remote control or device that he or she wishes to control into the Scan-5's 9-pin port.

In the Auto mode, the user activates the switch to start the scan. The first button lights up and speaks and waits for a set period of time for the user to activate the switch. If the user does not activate the switch, the next button lights up and is announced. This process continues through the last button. The scan stops if no selection is made, and the user can activate the switch to start again. A Step Scan requires two switches. The second switch ""steps"" through the choices so each time that the user presses the switch, the Scan-5 lights up and speaks the next button. The original switch functions as the selected switch so when the desired button is lit up, the user activates this switch and the Scan-5 ""presses"" that button to perform the desired function.

They are not quite sure which side the letter loop should go on. With Tilt It, children will learn the correct position of letter loops by being challenged to tilt the device in the correct direction to form letters.The second activity, Flip It, allows children to practice what they learned while honing their letter discrimination skills. Using arcade game action, Flip It challenges kids to visually discriminate and manipulate letters and words to match the correct orientation. The activity will help hone their visual discrimination skills and further cement their knowledge of correct letter and word formation.","['kid', 'child', 'p ”', 'letter loops', 'app', 'Flip', 'position', 'discrimination skills', 'game action', 'Tilt', 'version', 'device', 'q ”', 'left', '“ b ”', 'word', 'result', 'backwards', 'activity', 'orientation', 'reason', 'letter reversals', 'letter', 'direction', 'practice', 'letter loop', 'd ”', 'word formation', 'research', 'knowledge', 'letter discrimination skills', 'right', 'LetterReflex', 'childhood development']",02/24/2014,https://abledata.acl.gov/product/letterreflex-version-111

471,Bladdermanager Pci (Personal Care Instrument) 5000,The BladderManager is a portable ultrasound unit with a sensor to monitor bladder fullness for individuals with spinal cord injury and others who must perform intermitent catheterization to enable cateterization to be done on the basis of bladder volume rather than on a timed schedule. This non-invasive monitoring device transmits low energy ultrasound waves which are reflected off the bladder wall. Data are processed to inform the user of current bladder volume. The user is alerted visually to the scan results by a liquid crystal display (LCD) on the unit. An audible alarm also sounds when bladder volume exceeds a preprogrammed threshold. An alarm will also sound if the user has exceeded a specified period between catheterizations or voids. The unit consists of a scanhead attached to the scanner display and powerpack with a cord. DIMENSIONS (LxWxH): The scanhead is 3.2 x 2.6 x 1.2 inches and the scanner unit is 6.5 x 3.5 x 1.7 inches. WEIGHT: The scanhead weigs .33 pound and the scanner weighs .88 pound.

486,Lifestyle Hd (Model Hd730),"The LifeStyle HD, model HD730, is a high-definition desktop video magnifier (CCTV) designed to provide high resolution magnification of printed materials, photographs, and objects for individuals with low vision. This unit has more than 150 magnification levels from 3.1x (22-inch monitor) or 3.4x (24-inch monitor) to 95x. The magnification increases in 0.1x increments from 3.1x to 10x (for example: 3.1x, 3.2x, 3.3x etc.), and in 1x increments from 11x to 95x. The user can control the level of magnification and how wide of a view is displayed on the screen. For many users, the high resolution makes text readable at a lower magnification, due to its sharper image, allowing them to view a wider field of text with more letters or words displayed across the line, requiring less movement of the X/Y reading table. For photos, the lower magnification level allows a wider field of view, so the natural color image shows more definition and detail. The high definition monitor can move vertically, tilt forward and back and swivel left and right to optimize the viewing angle. ""Power,"" ""Zoom"", and ""Mode"" buttons are located on the front panel under the screen. The two large, ergonomic ""Zoom"" buttons control magnification. Pushing the upper button increases the magnification, and to lower button decreases the magnification. The ""Mode"" buttons (left and right arrow button) select or change the image mode. Image modes color, enhanced reverse image (white letters on a black background), enhanced black and white, and normal black and white. In addition, the user can select four custom display modes by choosing from a palette of 28 text and background combinations, such as yellow text on black. The user can set horizontal or vertical Line Markers to help guide reading across a row of text or separate columns of a table or spreadsheet, or create a horizontal or vertical window view by adjusting the Window mode button. The user can also plug in a DVI-D cable to connect the unit to a personal computer and then toggle back and forth to switch between a full screen view of the video magnifier image or the full screen view of the computer display. Users have the option to select between Picture Mode, in which all text, photos, pictures, graphs, and similar images are displayed in geometric proportion, or Text Mode, in which the text and spacing between letters are slightly expanded making it visually more comfortable for some users.

487,Outdoor Play Activity Center,"PROTOTYPE --- PURPOSE: To design a sensory-stimulating outdoor play activity center for children with limited physical and cognitive abilities. The prototype frame structure consists of five activity stations and nine different activities. The frame structure is weatherproof, height-adjustable, and can be easily dismantled for storage. Activities are designed to stimulate the visual, auditory, and tactile senses. Components are interchangeable and removable for cleaning or storage. The frame is constructed from 1.25-inch red furniture-grade PVC. To provide stability, but also allow the device to be removed if necessary, the 5- inch-long vertical posts of the frame are inserted into 12-inch-long stainless steel sleeves,each of which is 2 inches in diameter, which are submerged into holes in the ground (made with a garden auger and drill). The six vertical pipes are connected via L- or T-joints to similar PVC beams, 32.5 inches long, parallel to the ground. The resulting height of the PVC beams is 4 inches. Five powder-coated green clothesline hooks are evenly spaced on the vertical posts, 36 to 44 inches above the ground. Each hook extends 6 inches in front of the vertical posts, so that wheelchairs can remain on the flat concrete patio, away from the adjacent grass slope. For each activity station, a 36-inch-long, half-inch PVC pipe is supported at each end by the clothesline hooks. Two of the nine stations are directly connected to these horizontal activity bars via custom attachments with three components. A nylon strap loops around the PVC bar and extends five inches to a plastic buckle. This buckle allows length adjustment of the nylon strap. The other end of the nylon strap loops through the terminal link of an 8-inch segment of garden-grade plastic chain. The other terminal link of this chain attaches to a connecting device, either a metal key ring or a plastic latch, which attaches to the activity. A variety of activities were designed to meet the needs of the client. The designs were inspired by toys currently on the market. All the activities are visually stimulating as they are brightly colored. Three of the activities stimulate the tactile sense. Activity A consists of strings of plastic beads hung vertically from a dowel rod. Activity B is a series of three rubber balls of varying textures. Activity C uses a commercially- available children’s toy that vibrates and talks when activated. This toy was switch adapted with a standard 1/8 inch phone jack so that vibration and sound occur only upon pressing the switch. Five other activities also reinforce the learning of cause and effect. Activity D is a commercially available bubble maker that was switch adapted to produce bubbles when the switch is pressed. Activity E consists of painted wooden balls within a clear plastic container. The container is attached directly to the horizontal activity bar and has three large knobs around the perimeter. When the user pushes the knobs, the container rotates and balls roll around within the container. Activities F through I also reinforce the concept of cause and effect and stimulate the auditory sense. Activity F is a “rain-stick.” A clear plastic tube containing beads and obstructions to the beads is attached directly to the horizontal activity bar. When the user rotates the tube about the horizontal bar, beads fall from one end to the other, creating a sound similar to rain. Activity G consists of seven hand bells, each producing a different note when hit. Activity H is constructed from four plastic Christmas ornaments, each containing small beads that rattle when the ornaments are swung. Activity I consists of a large colorful wooden butterfly attached to a commercially available wind chime. TITLE: Outdoor Play Activity Center.
